# Parts

1. Reed relays in DPST, NC, 2Ch are hard to find, replace with PhotoMOS relays? 
2. AOZ1280CI buck regulator is unobtainium, maybe different scheme for 3.3V supply? Research!
	-> Replaced with AP5100 and edited schematic
3. Screw Terminals are expensive in large amounts, selection is limited for single units.
