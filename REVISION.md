# Revision List

1. J4 & J5 Footprint is different from Schematic, Odd-Even instead of Top-Bottom. Change if necessary
2. AVR Reset Pulldown resistor value?
3. C16 is polarized tantalum cap, mark on PCB accordingly
4. Maybe include status LED for power supply?
5. Increase resistors on button input (button press can dissipate over 1W!!!) 1k w/o voltage divider
6. Can U8 supply enough current to unlock the solenoid?? -> 25 ohms * 4 -> 100 ohms / 1W ?? in SMD??
7. Footprint of AC/DC PSU mirrored!!!!
